## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.

Then, if it is your first time downloading, open Andriod Studio and "Open Existing Project" (has folder icon). Open the folder (unzipped) you just downloaded and you may begin coding.

*You should realy be using sourcetree but i can't be bothered to explain that now. See last step (line 10)*

Note that the wiki is an "evergreen" document that is constantly being updated and edited.  It contains the most current information about the *FIRST* Tech Challenge software and control system.

Figure the rest out yourself
